        "The goal of this assignment is to use TensorFlow to build some recurrent neural nets (RNNs) and to understand their limitations through experimentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Task\n",
        "You will implement a recurrent neural net to learn the parity operator. The net will have a single input unit and a single output unit, and a fully-connected layer of H hidden units. The inputs and target outputs are binary. When an input sequence is presented, the output state at the end of the sequence should be a parity bit: output should be 1 if the input has an odd number of '1' values. For example, the sequence 1-0-0-1-0-1 should yield output 1 and the sequence 0-0-0-0-1-1 should yield output 0. Note that a target is given only at the end of each sequence. (Parity is easy to learn if there is a target at each step that indicates parity given the sequence so far.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Parity is a hard problem for neural nets to learn because very similar inputs produce different outputs, and very dissimilar inputs can produce the same output.\n",
        "\n",
        "The aspects of the task we will manipulate are:  H, the number of hidden units, N, the length of the input strings, and the activation function for the hidden units, either tanh or LSTM-style neurons. The output neuron should have a logistic activation function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tip: get started early.  Depending on your system, these nets can take several minutes to train.  Exploring hyperparameters (such as training rate) will be critical for success.\n"
